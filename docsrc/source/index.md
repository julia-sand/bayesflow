# BayesFlow

BayesFlow is a Python library for efficient Bayesian inference with deep learning.
It provides users with:

- A user-friendly API for [amortized Bayesian workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04332)
- A rich collection of generative models, [from diffusion to consistency models](https://bayesflow-org.github.io/diffusion-experiments/)
- Multi-backend support via [Keras3](https://keras.io/keras_3/): You can use [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), or [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax)

## Conceptual Overview

  <img alt="Overview graphic on using BayesFlow. It is split in three columns: 1. Simulate: generate data from any simulation you like. 2. Amortize: use BayesFlow to define your neural estimator with any deep learning backend you choose, as it is part of the Keras ecosystem. 3. Learn: with powerful generative AI and robust diagnostic features, BayesFlow is the gold-standard toolkit for simulation intelligence." src="_static/bayesflow_landing_dark.png">

</div>

A cornerstone idea of amortized Bayesian inference is to employ generative
neural networks for parameter estimation, model comparison, and model validation
when working with intractable simulators whose behavior as a whole is too
complex to be described analytically.

## Install

We currently support Python 3.11 to 3.13. You can install the latest stable version from PyPI using:

```bash
pip install "bayesflow>=2.0"
```

If you want the latest features, you can install from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bayesflow-org/bayesflow.git@dev
```

If you encounter problems with this or require more control, please refer to the instructions to install from source below.

### Backend

To use BayesFlow, you will also need to install one of the following machine learning backends.
Note that BayesFlow **will not run** without a backend.

- [Install JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
- [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [Install TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

If you don't know which backend to use, we recommend JAX as it is currently the fastest backend.

As of version ``2.0.7``, the backend will be set automatically. If you have multiple backends, you can manually [set the backend environment variable as described by keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/#configuring-your-backend).
For example, inside your Python script write:

```python
import os
os.environ["KERAS_BACKEND"] = "jax"
import bayesflow
```

If you use conda, you can alternatively set this individually for each environment in your terminal. For example:

```bash
conda env config vars set KERAS_BACKEND=jax
```

Or just plainly set the environment variable in your shell:

```bash
export KERAS_BACKEND=jax
```

## Getting Started

Using the high-level interface is easy, as demonstrated by the minimal working example below:

```python
import bayesflow as bf

workflow = bf.BasicWorkflow(
    inference_network=bf.networks.FlowMatching(),
    inference_variables=["parameters"],
    inference_conditions=["observables"],
    simulator=bf.simulators.SIR()
)

history = workflow.fit_online(epochs=20, batch_size=32, num_batches_per_epoch=200)

diagnostics = workflow.plot_default_diagnostics(test_data=300)
```

## Citing BayesFlow

If you are using the new multi-backend version of BayesFlow, we recommend citing our new [software paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07098) (Kühmichel et al., 2026). For uses of the [legacy version](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05702), you can still reference Radev et al., (2023).

## FAQ

-------------

**Question:**
I am starting with Bayesflow, which backend should I use?

**Answer:**
We recommend JAX as it is currently the fastest backend.

-------------

**Question:**
I am getting `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'` when I try to import BayesFlow.

**Answer:**
One of these applies:
- You want to use tensorflow as your backend, but you have not installed it.
See [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).


- You want to use a backend other than tensorflow, but have not set the environment variable correctly.
See [here](https://keras.io/getting_started/#configuring-your-backend).


- You have set the environment variable, but it is not being picked up by Python.
This can happen silently in some development environments (e.g., VSCode or PyCharm).
Try setting the backend as shown [here](https://keras.io/getting_started/#configuring-your-backend)
in your Python script via `os.environ`.

-------------

**Question:**
What is the difference between Bayesflow 2.0+ and previous versions?

**Answer:**
BayesFlow 2.0+ is a complete rewrite of the library. It shares the same
overall goals with previous versions, but has much better modularity
and extensibility. What is more, the new BayesFlow has multi-backend support via Keras3,
while the old version was based on TensorFlow.

-------------

**Question:**
Should I switch to BayesFlow 2.0+ now? Are there features that are still missing?

**Answer:**
In general, we recommend to switch, as the new version is easier to use and will continue
to receive improvements and new features. However, a few features are still missing, so you
might want to wait until everything you need has been ported to BayesFlow 2.0+.

Depending on your needs, you might not want to upgrade yet if one of the following applies:

- You have an ongoing project that uses BayesFlow 1.x, and you do not want to allocate
  time for migrating it to the new API.
- You have already trained models in BayesFlow 1.x, that you do not want to re-train
  with the new version. Loading models from version 1.x in version 2.0+ is not supported.
- You require a feature that was not ported to BayesFlow 2.0+ yet. To our knowledge,
  this applies to:
  * Two-level/Hierarchical models (planned for version 2.1): `TwoLevelGenerativeModel`, `TwoLevelPrior`.
  * Sensitivity analysis (partially discontinued): functionality from the `bayesflow.sensitivity` module. This is still
    possible, but we do no longer offer a special module for it. We plan to add a tutorial on this, see [#455](https://github.com/bayesflow-org/bayesflow/issues/455).
  * MCMC (discontinued): The `bayesflow.mcmc` module. We are considering other options
    to enable the use of BayesFlow in an MCMC setting.
  * Networks: `EvidentialNetwork`.
  * Model misspecification detection: MMD test in the summary space (see [#384](https://github.com/bayesflow-org/bayesflow/issues/384)).

If you encounter any functionality that is missing and not listed here, please let us
know by opening an issue.

-------------

**Question:**
I still need the old BayesFlow for some of my projects. How can I install it?

**Answer:**
You can find and install the old Bayesflow version via the `stable-legacy` branch on GitHub.
The corresponding [documentation](https://bayesflow.org/stable-legacy/index.html) can be
accessed by selecting the "stable-legacy" entry in the version picker of the documentation.

You can also install the latest version of BayesFlow v1.x from PyPI using

```
pip install "bayesflow<2.0"
```
